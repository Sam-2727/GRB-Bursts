# GRB-Bursts
Here I provide the code for the paper entitled "Re-Examining the Evidence of the Hercules-Corona-Borealis Great Wall".

The code makes more sense when reading the paper. In the paper, I present a brief overview of each test.
The interested reader might also find this powerpoint (link once finished) interesting, as some figures that aren't in the paper are presented there

## Update Log
January 2020: Code cleaned up and renamed for clarity.
